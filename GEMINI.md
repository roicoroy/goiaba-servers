# Gemini Interaction Log

This file logs the key decisions and actions taken during my interaction with the user on the Goiaba Servers project.

## Session Start: 2025-09-17

### Initial Goal: Project Refinement

The initial goal was to analyze the project and improve its structure.

### Key Actions Taken:

1.  **Project Analysis:** Analyzed the `package.json`, `docker-compose.yml`, and various `README.md` files to understand the project architecture.
2.  **New Root README:** Created a comprehensive `README.md` for the project root to document the architecture, setup, and usage.
3.  **Directory Renaming:** Renamed the `medusa2-marketplace-demo` directory to `medusa-server` for better clarity.
4.  **Docker Restructuring:**
    *   Refactored the monolithic `docker-compose.yml` into a modular structure.
    *   Each main service (`medusa-server`, `strapi-server`, `shared-auth-middleware`) now has its own `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   The root `docker-compose.yml` now only manages the shared network and Nginx proxy.
5.  **Script Updates:** Updated the `docker-setup.sh` and `package.json` scripts to work with the new modular Docker setup.

### Current Status:

We are currently troubleshooting a Docker environment issue ("input/output error") that is preventing the Docker images from being built successfully. The next step is for the user to try the suggested troubleshooting steps (pruning Docker system, restarting Docker).

## Session Start: 2025-09-18

### Previous Goal: Project Refinement and Docker Troubleshooting

The previous session focused on refactoring the project into a modular architecture and addressing a Docker environment issue.

### Key Actions Taken:

1.  **Docker Pruning:** Attempted to prune the Docker system to resolve the "input/output error". The user cancelled the operation.

### Current Status & Plan:

The primary goal is to get the refactored Docker environment up and running successfully.

The plan is as follows:

1.  **Run Docker Setup:** Execute the `docker-setup.sh` script to build and start all services according to the new modular `docker-compose` structure.
2.  **Verify Services:** Check the status of all running containers to ensure that `medusa-server`, `strapi-server`, `shared-auth-middleware`, and the `nginx` proxy are all running correctly.
3.  **Integration Testing:** Once the services are confirmed to be running, perform integration tests to validate that the unified authentication system and the communication between the different services are functioning as expected.
4.  **Troubleshooting:** If any of the above steps fail, analyze the logs and troubleshoot the specific issues.
